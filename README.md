# Music-generation-using-Deep-Learning
The aim of the project is to generate new music which is not present in the training dataset,  by training the deep learning model with existing music. The objectives of this specific use case can be highly applicable in many business contexts. In particular, given the highly competitive market dynamics of the music streaming industry, this type of capability or application can be highly valuable for companies in this space to differentiate and deliver added value to customers by providing highly customized music to their audience. Additionally, this can enable companies such as Spotify, Amazon, Apple, and others to generate their own content for user consumption without needing to license music from artists or mainstream music labels, reducing costs and providing a unique experience.
In order to develop this use case, we leveraged existing music data to train the deep learning model. The model learns existing patterns in the music data and generated new and meaningful music notes.

A detailed report about the dataset, explanation for the code and approach is also shared in the reporsitory. Please refer to "MMAI 894 - Music Generation using Deep Learning_final report"
